Hi, my name is Denis.
I am an habitant of this island, one of the few left.
It was a day like any others, when a virus attacked us.
People started turning into zombies and it became a war zone.
Speaking of you...
I saw you crashed with that plane, you look like the only survivor.
During the flight I noticed that the plane was losing pieces,
they looked like antennas.
It may have been the problem.
Searching the island you might find the pieces to go home.
But beware that it is full of zombies ready to do anything to eat you.

Tutorial:
-wasd, move player
-p, talk npc
-e, switch build system
-1/2/3, switch weapons/builds
-r, recharge
-mouse left, shot, build
-left shift, run
-v, take items
-f, swith first/third person
-space, jump

You can take 2 different type of items:
-food, gives you life
-ammo, gives you ammo for shooting

There is one piece of antenna in the woods, search it and then go in the other village.
Keep this ammo and...
Good luck.
